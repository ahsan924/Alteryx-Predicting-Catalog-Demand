# Predicting-Catalog-Demand-in-Alteryx

## Step 1: Business and Data Understanding 
#### 1. What decisions needs to be made?
a. As the model depicts and the analysis on the data supports the decision of mailing the catalog out to the new customers with the expected profit from these 250 new customers be around $21,987.43 which exceeds the minimum target profit of $10,000.
#### 2. What data is needed to inform those decisions?
a. While our target is ‘Avg_Sale_Amount’ that needs to be predicted, two of the predictor variables ‘Customer_Segment’ and ‘Avg_Num_Products_Purchased’ are highly significant for predicting the final value.
b. Another important data needed was the cost of printing and distribution i.e. $6.5 of each catalog and the average gross margin of 50%.
